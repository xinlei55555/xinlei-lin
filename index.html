        <h2>Greetings!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Montrealer studying Computer Science specialist and Molecular Genetics major at the University of Toronto. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am affiliated with KITE (University Health Network) with Professor <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~taati/index.htm" target="_blank">Babak Taati</a>, where I worked on video human 2D keypoint pose detection and human mesh recovery with InfiniAttention and VideoMamba through the NSERC fund.
        </p>
        <p>  
            I am also working at the Medical Imaging Department at the University of Toronto with Professor <a href="https://www.tyrrell4innovation.ca/" target="_blank">Pascal N. Tyrrell</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was fortunate to be 1 of 12 teams representing Team Canada at the International Science and Engineering Fair with a computer vision project which was further expanded with Professor <a href="https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~sahraouh/index_eng.html" target="_blank">Houari Sahraoui</a> at DIRO (Universite de Montreal).
        </p>
        <p>
            In my freetime, I am a bookworm who loves to eat pho and find niche cafes to study and enjoy a chai latte!
